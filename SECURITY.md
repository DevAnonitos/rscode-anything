## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers privately through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: What you expected to happen vs what actually happened
- **Environment**: Operating system, browser, version numbers, etc.
- **Potential Impact**: How this vulnerability could be exploited
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, a minimal proof of concept

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
4. **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue and keep you updated on our progress
5. **Credit**: We will credit you for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: We aim to patch within 24-48 hours
- **High severity**: We aim to patch within 1 week
- **Medium severity**: We aim to patch within 2 weeks
- **Low severity**: We aim to patch within 1 month

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always keep your installation up to date
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly review and audit your configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Keep backups of important data

### For Contributors

- Follow secure coding practices
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review code changes for security implications
- Use static analysis tools
- Follow the principle of least privilege in your code
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- We do not store sensitive user data unnecessarily
- All data transmission is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- We follow GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations

### Authentication & Authorization

- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Use strong password policies
- Implement proper session management
- Follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards where applicable
- Use multi-factor authentication when possible

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper file upload validation
- Use content security policies

### Dependencies

- Regularly audit and update dependencies
- Use tools like `npm audit`, `snyk`, or similar
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use dependency pinning where appropriate
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security Checks

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis for potential security issues
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of accidentally committed secrets

### Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review processes with security focus
- Threat modeling for new features

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitor for security incidents
2. **Assessment**: Quickly assess the severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Take immediate steps to contain the incident
4. **Investigation**: Thoroughly investigate the root cause
5. **Remediation**: Fix the issue and implement preventive measures
6. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
7. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
8. **Lessons Learned**: Document lessons learned and improve processes

### Communication

- We will notify users of security incidents that may affect them
- We will provide clear, actionable information
- We will maintain transparency while protecting sensitive details
- We will coordinate with security researchers and the broader community
